Sorting algorithms are algorithms that arrange a collection of elements in a specific order, such as numerical or alphabetical order. There are numerous sorting algorithms available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and stability. Here are some commonly used sorting algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort: It repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order until the entire list is sorted. Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it inefficient for large datasets.

2. Insertion Sort: It builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting each element into its proper position. Insertion sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) but performs well for small lists or partially sorted lists.

3. Selection Sort: It divides the input list into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. Selection sort also has a time complexity of O(n^2).

4. Merge Sort: It follows the divide-and-conquer strategy. It divides the input array into two halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges the two sorted halves to obtain a single sorted array. Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is efficient for large datasets. It requires additional space for the merging process.

5. Quick Sort: It also follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It selects an element called a pivot and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, one with elements less than the pivot and the other with elements greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sub-arrays. Quick sort has an average time complexity of O(n log n), but its worst-case time complexity is O(n^2) when the pivot selection is unbalanced.

6. Heap Sort: It uses the heap data structure to sort elements. It first builds a max-heap or min-heap, depending on the desired order, and repeatedly extracts the root element, which is the largest or smallest element, and places it at the end of the sorted array. Heap sort has a time complexity of O(n log n).

7. Radix Sort: It sorts the elements by processing them digit by digit. It sorts the elements based on the values of their digits, starting from the least significant digit to the most significant one. Radix sort has a time complexity of O(kn), where k is the maximum number of digits in the input.

These are just a few examples of sorting algorithms, and there are many other variations and hybrid algorithms that aim to improve performance or adapt to specific scenarios. The choice of sorting algorithm depends on factors such as the size of the dataset, the desired order, stability requirements, available memory, and expected performance.
